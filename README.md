# NullVoice

A simple Blazor web app that allows users to say whatever they want into the void and have it float for eternity with the fellow null voices

## Why?

I wanted to learn .NET and Blazor and more about how it works. So in this I ensured I learned the basics of EF([entity framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/blazor-ef-core?view=aspnetcore-9.0)) and JS interop.

JS interop was an after thought when I realised I wanted a way to visualise the data in a cool way. This meant including the [P5js](https://p5js.org/) library!

## How to run


### Visual studio

1. Clone the repo
2. CD into NullVoice
3. Open an instance of visual studio (or to skip step 4, double click NullVoice.sln)
4. Click on the NullVoice Folder
5. Click the green run button named "https"

### CLI/Visual studio code

1. Clone the repo
2. Open the NullVoice folder in vsCode
3. CD into NullVoice from the integrated terminal
4. write dotnet run (assuming you have dotnet)
